# Optimising build order for cultural point (CP) efficiency in Travian

This is a script for generating a build order that optimise the efficiency of CP-generating buildings either by resource or time in Travian: Legends.

## Usage

1. Change the *current_level* constant in *data_processing.py* to the current level of your buildings.  
For presets, you can use "only core" or "all empty" which correspond to only major CP buildings or all buildings, respectively.

2. Run *data_processing.py* to generate the build order CSV.

## Note

- The data may not be accurate, especially for the time data.
- This is for Travian: Legends, not Travian Kingdoms.
